#&gt; 1   No.1: Background: The complex and dynamic changes during grape berry development have been studied in Vitis vinifera, but little is known about these processes in other Vitis species. The grape variety \xe2\xac\xdcNorton\xe2\xac", with a major portion of its genome derived from Vitis aestivalis, maintains high levels of malic acid and phenolic acids in the ripening berries in comparison with V. vinifera varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon. Furthermore, Norton berries develop a remarkably high level of resistance to most fungal pathogens while Cabernet Sauvignon berries remain susceptible to those pathogens. The distinct characteristics of Norton and Cabernet Sauvignon merit a comprehensive analysis of transcriptional regulation and metabolite pathways. Results: A microarray study was conducted on transcriptome changes of Norton berry skin during the period of 37 to 127 days after bloom, which represents berry developmental phases from herbaceous growth to full ripeness. Samples of six berry developmental stages were collected. Analysis of the microarray data revealed that a total of 3,352 probe sets exhibited significant differences at transcript levels, with two-fold changes between at least two developmental stages. Expression profiles of defense-related genes showed a dynamic modulation of nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) resistance genes and pathogenesis-related (PR) genes during berry development. Transcript levels of PR-1 in Norton berry skin clearly increased during the ripening phase. As in other grapevines, genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway were up-regulated in Norton as the berry developed. The most noticeable was the steady increase of transcript levels of stilbene synthase genes. Transcriptional patterns of six MYB transcription factors and eleven structural genes of the flavonoid pathway and profiles of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins (PAs) during berry skin development were analyzed comparatively in Norton and Cabernet Sauvignon. Transcriptional patterns of MYB5A and MYB5B were similar during berry development between the two varieties, but those of MYBPA1 and MYBPA2 were strikingly different, demonstrating that the general flavonoid pathways are regulated under different MYB factors. The data showed that there were higher transcript levels of the genes encoding flavonoid-3´-O-hydroxylase (F3´H), flavonoid-3´,5´-hydroxylase (F3´5´H), leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX), UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3´-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT), anthocyanidin reductase (ANR), leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) 1 and LAR2 in berry skin of Norton than in those of Cabernet Sauvignon. It was also found that the total amount of anthocyanins was markedly higher in Norton than in Cabernet Sauvignon berry skin at harvest, and five anthocyanin derivatives and three PA compounds exhibited distinctive accumulation patterns in Norton berry skin. Conclusions: This study provides an overview of the transcriptome changes and the flavonoid profiles in the berry skin of Norton, an important North American wine grape, during berry development. The steady increase of transcripts of PR-1 and stilbene synthase genes likely contributes to the developmentally regulated resistance during ripening of Norton berries. More studies are required to address the precise role of each stilbene synthase gene in berry development and disease resistance. Transcriptional regulation of MYBA1, MYBA2, MYB5A and MYBPA1 as well as expression levels of their putative targets F3´H, F3´5´H, LDOX, UFGT, ANR LAR1, and LAR2 are highly correlated with the characteristic anthocyanin and PA profiles of Norton berry skin. These results reveal a unique pattern of the regulation of transcription and biosynthesis pathways underlying the viticultural and enological characteristics of Norton grape, and yield new insights into the understanding of the flavonoid pathway in non-vinifera grape varieties.

These results reveal a unique pattern of the regulation of transcription and biosynthesis pathways underlying the viticultural and enological characteristics of Norton grape, and yield new insights into the understanding of the flavonoid pathway in non-vinifera grape varieties.
#&gt; 6   No.1: Background: The complex and dynamic changes during grape berry development have been studied in Vitis vinifera, but little is known about these processes in other Vitis species. The grape variety \xe2\xac\xdcNorton\xe2\xac", with a major portion of its genome derived from Vitis aestivalis, maintains high levels of malic acid and phenolic acids in the ripening berries in comparison with V. vinifera varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon. Furthermore, Norton berries develop a remarkably high level of resistance to most fungal pathogens while Cabernet Sauvignon berries remain susceptible to those pathogens. The distinct characteristics of Norton and Cabernet Sauvignon merit a comprehensive analysis of transcriptional regulation and metabolite pathways. Results: A microarray study was conducted on transcriptome changes of Norton berry skin during the period of 37 to 127 days after bloom, which represents berry developmental phases from herbaceous growth to full ripeness. Samples of six berry developmental stages were collected. Analysis of the microarray data revealed that a total of 3,352 probe sets exhibited significant differences at transcript levels, with two-fold changes between at least two developmental stages. Expression profiles of defense-related genes showed a dynamic modulation of nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) resistance genes and pathogenesis-related (PR) genes during berry development. Transcript levels of PR-1 in Norton berry skin clearly increased during the ripening phase. As in other grapevines, genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway were up-regulated in Norton as the berry developed. The most noticeable was the steady increase of transcript levels of stilbene synthase genes. Transcriptional patterns of six MYB transcription factors and eleven structural genes of the flavonoid pathway and profiles of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins (PAs) during berry skin development were analyzed comparatively in Norton and Cabernet Sauvignon. Transcriptional patterns of MYB5A and MYB5B were similar during berry development between the two varieties, but those of MYBPA1 and MYBPA2 were strikingly different, demonstrating that the general flavonoid pathways are regulated under different MYB factors. The data showed that there were higher transcript levels of the genes encoding flavonoid-3´-O-hydroxylase (F3´H), flavonoid-3´,5´-hydroxylase (F3´5´H), leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX), UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3´-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT), anthocyanidin reductase (ANR), leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) 1 and LAR2 in berry skin of Norton than in those of Cabernet Sauvignon. It was also found that the total amount of anthocyanins was markedly higher in Norton than in Cabernet Sauvignon berry skin at harvest, and five anthocyanin derivatives and three PA compounds exhibited distinctive accumulation patterns in Norton berry skin. Conclusions: This study provides an overview of the transcriptome changes and the flavonoid profiles in the berry skin of Norton, an important North American wine grape, during berry development. The steady increase of transcripts of PR-1 and stilbene synthase genes likely contributes to the developmentally regulated resistance during ripening of Norton berries.

The data showed that there were higher transcript levels of the genes encoding flavonoid-3´-O-hydroxylase (F3´H), flavonoid-3´,5´-hydroxylase (F3´5´H), leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX), UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3´-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT), anthocyanidin reductase (ANR), leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) 1 and LAR2 in berry skin of Norton than in those of Cabernet Sauvignon. It was also found that the total amount of anthocyanins was markedly higher in Norton than in Cabernet Sauvignon berry skin at harvest, and five anthocyanin derivatives and three PA compounds exhibited distinctive accumulation patterns in Norton berry skin. Conclusions: This study provides an overview of the transcriptome changes and the flavonoid profiles in the berry skin of Norton, an important North American wine grape, during berry development. The steady increase of transcripts of PR-1 and stilbene synthase genes likely contributes to the developmentally regulated resistance during ripening of Norton berries. More studies are required to address the precise role of each stilbene synthase gene in berry development and disease resistance. Transcriptional regulation of MYBA1, MYBA2, MYB5A and MYBPA1 as well as expression levels of their putative targets F3´H, F3´5´H, LDOX, UFGT, ANR LAR1, and LAR2 are highly correlated with the characteristic anthocyanin and PA profiles of Norton berry skin. These results reveal a unique pattern of the regulation of transcription and biosynthesis pathways underlying the viticultural and enological characteristics of Norton grape, and yield new insights into the understanding of the flavonoid pathway in non-vinifera grape varieties.
#&gt; 16  No.1: Background: The complex and dynamic changes during grape berry development have been studied in Vitis vinifera, but little is known about these processes in other Vitis species. The grape variety \xe2\xac\xdcNorton\xe2\xac", with a major portion of its genome derived from Vitis aestivalis, maintains high levels of malic acid and phenolic acids in the ripening berries in comparison with V. vinifera varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon. Furthermore, Norton berries develop a remarkably high level of resistance to most fungal pathogens while Cabernet Sauvignon berries remain susceptible to those pathogens. The distinct characteristics of Norton and Cabernet Sauvignon merit a comprehensive analysis of transcriptional regulation and metabolite pathways. Results: A microarray study was conducted on transcriptome changes of Norton berry skin during the period of 37 to 127 days after bloom, which represents berry developmental phases from herbaceous growth to full ripeness. Samples of six berry developmental stages were collected. Analysis of the microarray data revealed that a total of 3,352 probe sets exhibited significant differences at transcript levels, with two-fold changes between at least two developmental stages. Expression profiles of defense-related genes showed a dynamic modulation of nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) resistance genes and pathogenesis-related (PR) genes during berry development. Transcript levels of PR-1 in Norton berry skin clearly increased during the ripening phase. As in other grapevines, genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway were up-regulated in Norton as the berry developed. The most noticeable was the steady increase of transcript levels of stilbene synthase genes.

However, the complexity of molecular and biochemical events that lead to the onset of ripening in berries as well as how aroma is developed are aspects not fully understood. In an attempt to identify the common mechanisms associated with the onset of ripening independently of the cultivar, grapes of Portuguese elite cultivars, Trincadeira, Aragonês, and Touriga Nacional, were studied. The mRNA expression profiles corresponding to veraison (EL35) and to mature berries (EL36) were compared. Across the three varieties, 9,8% (2255) probesets corresponding to 1915 unigenes were robustly differentially expressed at EL 36 compared to EL 35. Eleven functional categories were represented in this differential gene set: primary metabolism, \xe2\xacSsecondary metabolism⬝, cellular metabolism⬝, development⬝, \xe2\xacScellular process⬝, \xe2\xacSdiverse functions⬝, \xe2\xacSregulation overview⬝, response to stimulus, stress⬝, \xe2\xacSsignaling⬝, \xe2\xacStransport overview⬝, and \xe2\xacSxenoprotein, transposable element⬝ besides 32.24% genes of \xe2\xacSunknown⬝ function. Information on gene expression related to primary and secondary metabolism was verified by RT-qPCR analysis of selected candidate genes at four developmental stages (EL32, EL35, EL36 and EL 38). Gene expression data were integrated with metabolic profiling data from GC-EI-TOF/ MS and headspace GC-EI-MS platforms. Molecular and metabolic markers of grape ripening related to primary and secondary metabolism were established and revealed a substantial developmental reprogramming of cellular metabolism. Altogether the results provide valuable new information on the main metabolic events leading to grape ripening. Furthermore, we provide first hints about how the development of a cultivar specific aroma is controlled at the transcriptional level.

However, the complexity of molecular and biochemical events that lead to the onset of ripening in berries as well as how aroma is developed are aspects not fully understood. In an attempt to identify the common mechanisms associated with the onset of ripening independently of the cultivar, grapes of Portuguese elite cultivars, Trincadeira, Aragonês, and Touriga Nacional, were studied. The mRNA expression profiles corresponding to veraison (EL35) and to mature berries (EL36) were compared. Across the three varieties, 9,8% (2255) probesets corresponding to 1915 unigenes were robustly differentially expressed at EL 36 compared to EL 35. Eleven functional categories were represented in this differential gene set: primary metabolism, \xe2\xacSsecondary metabolism⬝, cellular metabolism⬝, development⬝, \xe2\xacScellular process⬝, \xe2\xacSdiverse functions⬝, \xe2\xacSregulation overview⬝, response to stimulus, stress⬝, \xe2\xacSsignaling⬝, \xe2\xacStransport overview⬝, and \xe2\xacSxenoprotein, transposable element⬝ besides 32.24% genes of \xe2\xacSunknown⬝ function. Information on gene expression related to primary and secondary metabolism was verified by RT-qPCR analysis of selected candidate genes at four developmental stages (EL32, EL35, EL36 and EL 38). Gene expression data were integrated with metabolic profiling data from GC-EI-TOF/ MS and headspace GC-EI-MS platforms. Molecular and metabolic markers of grape ripening related to primary and secondary metabolism were established and revealed a substantial developmental reprogramming of cellular metabolism. Altogether the results provide valuable new information on the main metabolic events leading to grape ripening.

However, the complexity of molecular and biochemical events that lead to the onset of ripening in berries as well as how aroma is developed are aspects not fully understood. In an attempt to identify the common mechanisms associated with the onset of ripening independently of the cultivar, grapes of Portuguese elite cultivars, Trincadeira, Aragonês, and Touriga Nacional, were studied. The mRNA expression profiles corresponding to veraison (EL35) and to mature berries (EL36) were compared. Across the three varieties, 9,8% (2255) probesets corresponding to 1915 unigenes were robustly differentially expressed at EL 36 compared to EL 35. Eleven functional categories were represented in this differential gene set: primary metabolism, \xe2\xacSsecondary metabolism⬝, cellular metabolism⬝, development⬝, \xe2\xacScellular process⬝, \xe2\xacSdiverse functions⬝, \xe2\xacSregulation overview⬝, response to stimulus, stress⬝, \xe2\xacSsignaling⬝, \xe2\xacStransport overview⬝, and \xe2\xacSxenoprotein, transposable element⬝ besides 32.24% genes of \xe2\xacSunknown⬝ function. Information on gene expression related to primary and secondary metabolism was verified by RT-qPCR analysis of selected candidate genes at four developmental stages (EL32, EL35, EL36 and EL 38). Gene expression data were integrated with metabolic profiling data from GC-EI-TOF/ MS and headspace GC-EI-MS platforms. Molecular and metabolic markers of grape ripening related to primary and secondary metabolism were established and revealed a substantial developmental reprogramming of cellular metabolism. Altogether the results provide valuable new information on the main metabolic events leading to grape ripening.

However, the complexity of molecular and biochemical events that lead to the onset of ripening in berries as well as how aroma is developed are aspects not fully understood. In an attempt to identify the common mechanisms associated with the onset of ripening independently of the cultivar, grapes of Portuguese elite cultivars, Trincadeira, Aragonês, and Touriga Nacional, were studied. The mRNA expression profiles corresponding to veraison (EL35) and to mature berries (EL36) were compared. Across the three varieties, 9,8% (2255) probesets corresponding to 1915 unigenes were robustly differentially expressed at EL 36 compared to EL 35. Eleven functional categories were represented in this differential gene set: primary metabolism, \xe2\xacSsecondary metabolism⬝, cellular metabolism⬝, development⬝, \xe2\xacScellular process⬝, \xe2\xacSdiverse functions⬝, \xe2\xacSregulation overview⬝, response to stimulus, stress⬝, \xe2\xacSsignaling⬝, \xe2\xacStransport overview⬝, and \xe2\xacSxenoprotein, transposable element⬝ besides 32.24% genes of \xe2\xacSunknown⬝ function. Information on gene expression related to primary and secondary metabolism was verified by RT-qPCR analysis of selected candidate genes at four developmental stages (EL32, EL35, EL36 and EL 38). Gene expression data were integrated with metabolic profiling data from GC-EI-TOF/ MS and headspace GC-EI-MS platforms. Molecular and metabolic markers of grape ripening related to primary and secondary metabolism were established and revealed a substantial developmental reprogramming of cellular metabolism. Altogether the results provide valuable new information on the main metabolic events leading to grape ripening.

However, the complexity of molecular and biochemical events that lead to the onset of ripening in berries as well as how aroma is developed are aspects not fully understood. In an attempt to identify the common mechanisms associated with the onset of ripening independently of the cultivar, grapes of Portuguese elite cultivars, Trincadeira, Aragonês, and Touriga Nacional, were studied. The mRNA expression profiles corresponding to veraison (EL35) and to mature berries (EL36) were compared. Across the three varieties, 9,8% (2255) probesets corresponding to 1915 unigenes were robustly differentially expressed at EL 36 compared to EL 35. Eleven functional categories were represented in this differential gene set: primary metabolism, \xe2\xacSsecondary metabolism⬝, cellular metabolism⬝, development⬝, \xe2\xacScellular process⬝, \xe2\xacSdiverse functions⬝, \xe2\xacSregulation overview⬝, response to stimulus, stress⬝, \xe2\xacSsignaling⬝, \xe2\xacStransport overview⬝, and \xe2\xacSxenoprotein, transposable element⬝ besides 32.24% genes of \xe2\xacSunknown⬝ function. Information on gene expression related to primary and secondary metabolism was verified by RT-qPCR analysis of selected candidate genes at four developmental stages (EL32, EL35, EL36 and EL 38). Gene expression data were integrated with metabolic profiling data from GC-EI-TOF/ MS and headspace GC-EI-MS platforms. Molecular and metabolic markers of grape ripening related to primary and secondary metabolism were established and revealed a substantial developmental reprogramming of cellular metabolism. Altogether the results provide valuable new information on the main metabolic events leading to grape ripening.

However, the complexity of molecular and biochemical events that lead to the onset of ripening in berries as well as how aroma is developed are aspects not fully understood. In an attempt to identify the common mechanisms associated with the onset of ripening independently of the cultivar, grapes of Portuguese elite cultivars, Trincadeira, Aragonês, and Touriga Nacional, were studied. The mRNA expression profiles corresponding to veraison (EL35) and to mature berries (EL36) were compared. Across the three varieties, 9,8% (2255) probesets corresponding to 1915 unigenes were robustly differentially expressed at EL 36 compared to EL 35. Eleven functional categories were represented in this differential gene set: primary metabolism, \xe2\xacSsecondary metabolism⬝, cellular metabolism⬝, development⬝, \xe2\xacScellular process⬝, \xe2\xacSdiverse functions⬝, \xe2\xacSregulation overview⬝, response to stimulus, stress⬝, \xe2\xacSsignaling⬝, \xe2\xacStransport overview⬝, and \xe2\xacSxenoprotein, transposable element⬝ besides 32.24% genes of \xe2\xacSunknown⬝ function. Information on gene expression related to primary and secondary metabolism was verified by RT-qPCR analysis of selected candidate genes at four developmental stages (EL32, EL35, EL36 and EL 38). Gene expression data were integrated with metabolic profiling data from GC-EI-TOF/ MS and headspace GC-EI-MS platforms. Molecular and metabolic markers of grape ripening related to primary and secondary metabolism were established and revealed a substantial developmental reprogramming of cellular metabolism. Altogether the results provide valuable new information on the main metabolic events leading to grape ripening.

However, the complexity of molecular and biochemical events that lead to the onset of ripening in berries as well as how aroma is developed are aspects not fully understood. In an attempt to identify the common mechanisms associated with the onset of ripening independently of the cultivar, grapes of Portuguese elite cultivars, Trincadeira, Aragonês, and Touriga Nacional, were studied. The mRNA expression profiles corresponding to veraison (EL35) and to mature berries (EL36) were compared. Across the three varieties, 9,8% (2255) probesets corresponding to 1915 unigenes were robustly differentially expressed at EL 36 compared to EL 35. Eleven functional categories were represented in this differential gene set: primary metabolism, \xe2\xacSsecondary metabolism⬝, cellular metabolism⬝, development⬝, \xe2\xacScellular process⬝, \xe2\xacSdiverse functions⬝, \xe2\xacSregulation overview⬝, response to stimulus, stress⬝, \xe2\xacSsignaling⬝, \xe2\xacStransport overview⬝, and \xe2\xacSxenoprotein, transposable element⬝ besides 32.24% genes of \xe2\xacSunknown⬝ function. Information on gene expression related to primary and secondary metabolism was verified by RT-qPCR analysis of selected candidate genes at four developmental stages (EL32, EL35, EL36 and EL 38). Gene expression data were integrated with metabolic profiling data from GC-EI-TOF/ MS and headspace GC-EI-MS platforms. Molecular and metabolic markers of grape ripening related to primary and secondary metabolism were established and revealed a substantial developmental reprogramming of cellular metabolism. Altogether the results provide valuable new information on the main metabolic events leading to grape ripening. Furthermore, we provide first hints about how the development of a cultivar specific aroma is controlled at the transcriptional level.

The adaptation of plants to stress is a complex response triggered by cascades of molecular networks involved in stress perception, signal transduction, and the expression of specific stress-related genes and metabolites. Approaches such as array-based transcript profiling allow assessing the expression of thousands of genes in control and stress tissues. The variety Aragonês, used in wine production, was subjected to controlled individual abiotic stresses, WS and HS. Physiological effects were confirmed by measuring photosynthesis light curves at ambient CO2 and stepwise increasing irradiances.

The adaptation of plants to stress is a complex response triggered by cascades of molecular networks involved in stress perception, signal transduction, and the expression of specific stress-related genes and metabolites. Approaches such as array-based transcript profiling allow assessing the expression of thousands of genes in control and stress tissues. The variety Aragonês, used in wine production, was subjected to controlled individual abiotic stresses, WS and HS. Physiological effects were confirmed by measuring photosynthesis light curves at ambient CO2 and stepwise increasing irradiances.

Transcriptional profiles throughout flesh and skin ripening were followed in three biological replicas during two consecutive growing seasons in a table grape cultivar \xe2\xac\xdcMuscat Hamburg\xe2\xac". Berries were weekly picked off bunches (one bunch per vine from each selected vine) from june to august. For each sampling, berries were classified in five ripening stages based on monitoring developmental stages instead of a simple chronological sampling. They corresponded to pre-véraison (P), 50% véraison (V1), 100% véraison (V2), ripe 1 (R1), and ripe 2 R2). P samples were harvested as green, hard berries of at least 15 mm in size, according to touch-assessed hardiness. Véraison berries with half or full coloured skin surface corresponded to V1 and V2 samples. After véraison, ripening berries were classified according to their floatability in solutions with different NaCl densities, as an indication of the internal sugar concentration. At this stage berries were sampled with densities between 110-130 g NaCl/L for R1 and between 130-150 g NaCl/L for R2, which corresponded to commercially ripen table grape berries.

Transcriptional profiles throughout flesh and skin ripening were followed in three biological replicas during two consecutive growing seasons in a table grape cultivar \xe2\xac\xdcMuscat Hamburg\xe2\xac". Berries were weekly picked off bunches (one bunch per vine from each selected vine) from june to august. For each sampling, berries were classified in five ripening stages based on monitoring developmental stages instead of a simple chronological sampling. They corresponded to pre-véraison (P), 50% véraison (V1), 100% véraison (V2), ripe 1 (R1), and ripe 2 R2). P samples were harvested as green, hard berries of at least 15 mm in size, according to touch-assessed hardiness. Véraison berries with half or full coloured skin surface corresponded to V1 and V2 samples. After véraison, ripening berries were classified according to their floatability in solutions with different NaCl densities, as an indication of the internal sugar concentration. At this stage berries were sampled with densities between 110-130 g NaCl/L for R1 and between 130-150 g NaCl/L for R2, which corresponded to commercially ripen table grape berries. On each of the five samples, frozen berries were dissected and RNA from flesh and skin was obtained and processed for Grapegen Genechip microarray hybridizations. ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.

On each of the five samples, frozen berries were dissected and RNA from flesh and skin was obtained and processed for Grapegen Genechip microarray hybridizations. ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.

Transcriptional profiles throughout flesh and skin ripening were followed in three biological replicas during two consecutive growing seasons in a table grape cultivar \xe2\xac\xdcMuscat Hamburg\xe2\xac". Berries were weekly picked off bunches (one bunch per vine from each selected vine) from june to august. For each sampling, berries were classified in five ripening stages based on monitoring developmental stages instead of a simple chronological sampling. They corresponded to pre-véraison (P), 50% véraison (V1), 100% véraison (V2), ripe 1 (R1), and ripe 2 R2). P samples were harvested as green, hard berries of at least 15 mm in size, according to touch-assessed hardiness. Véraison berries with half or full coloured skin surface corresponded to V1 and V2 samples.

At this stage berries were sampled with densities between 110-130 g NaCl/L for R1 and between 130-150 g NaCl/L for R2, which corresponded to commercially ripen table grape berries. On each of the five samples, frozen berries were dissected and RNA from flesh and skin was obtained and processed for Grapegen Genechip microarray hybridizations. ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.

At this stage berries were sampled with densities between 110-130 g NaCl/L for R1 and between 130-150 g NaCl/L for R2, which corresponded to commercially ripen table grape berries. On each of the five samples, frozen berries were dissected and RNA from flesh and skin was obtained and processed for Grapegen Genechip microarray hybridizations. ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.

At this stage berries were sampled with densities between 110-130 g NaCl/L for R1 and between 130-150 g NaCl/L for R2, which corresponded to commercially ripen table grape berries. On each of the five samples, frozen berries were dissected and RNA from flesh and skin was obtained and processed for Grapegen Genechip microarray hybridizations. ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.

At this stage berries were sampled with densities between 110-130 g NaCl/L for R1 and between 130-150 g NaCl/L for R2, which corresponded to commercially ripen table grape berries. On each of the five samples, frozen berries were dissected and RNA from flesh and skin was obtained and processed for Grapegen Genechip microarray hybridizations. ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.

At this stage berries were sampled with densities between 110-130 g NaCl/L for R1 and between 130-150 g NaCl/L for R2, which corresponded to commercially ripen table grape berries. On each of the five samples, frozen berries were dissected and RNA from flesh and skin was obtained and processed for Grapegen Genechip microarray hybridizations. ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.

At this stage berries were sampled with densities between 110-130 g NaCl/L for R1 and between 130-150 g NaCl/L for R2, which corresponded to commercially ripen table grape berries. On each of the five samples, frozen berries were dissected and RNA from flesh and skin was obtained and processed for Grapegen Genechip microarray hybridizations. ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.

At this stage berries were sampled with densities between 110-130 g NaCl/L for R1 and between 130-150 g NaCl/L for R2, which corresponded to commercially ripen table grape berries. On each of the five samples, frozen berries were dissected and RNA from flesh and skin was obtained and processed for Grapegen Genechip microarray hybridizations. ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.

At this stage berries were sampled with densities between 110-130 g NaCl/L for R1 and between 130-150 g NaCl/L for R2, which corresponded to commercially ripen table grape berries. On each of the five samples, frozen berries were dissected and RNA from flesh and skin was obtained and processed for Grapegen Genechip microarray hybridizations. ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.

At this stage berries were sampled with densities between 110-130 g NaCl/L for R1 and between 130-150 g NaCl/L for R2, which corresponded to commercially ripen table grape berries. On each of the five samples, frozen berries were dissected and RNA from flesh and skin was obtained and processed for Grapegen Genechip microarray hybridizations. ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.

At this stage berries were sampled with densities between 110-130 g NaCl/L for R1 and between 130-150 g NaCl/L for R2, which corresponded to commercially ripen table grape berries. On each of the five samples, frozen berries were dissected and RNA from flesh and skin was obtained and processed for Grapegen Genechip microarray hybridizations. ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.

At this stage berries were sampled with densities between 110-130 g NaCl/L for R1 and between 130-150 g NaCl/L for R2, which corresponded to commercially ripen table grape berries. On each of the five samples, frozen berries were dissected and RNA from flesh and skin was obtained and processed for Grapegen Genechip microarray hybridizations. ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.

At this stage berries were sampled with densities between 110-130 g NaCl/L for R1 and between 130-150 g NaCl/L for R2, which corresponded to commercially ripen table grape berries. On each of the five samples, frozen berries were dissected and RNA from flesh and skin was obtained and processed for Grapegen Genechip microarray hybridizations. ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.

At this stage berries were sampled with densities between 110-130 g NaCl/L for R1 and between 130-150 g NaCl/L for R2, which corresponded to commercially ripen table grape berries. On each of the five samples, frozen berries were dissected and RNA from flesh and skin was obtained and processed for Grapegen Genechip microarray hybridizations. ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.

At this stage berries were sampled with densities between 110-130 g NaCl/L for R1 and between 130-150 g NaCl/L for R2, which corresponded to commercially ripen table grape berries. On each of the five samples, frozen berries were dissected and RNA from flesh and skin was obtained and processed for Grapegen Genechip microarray hybridizations. ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.

At this stage berries were sampled with densities between 110-130 g NaCl/L for R1 and between 130-150 g NaCl/L for R2, which corresponded to commercially ripen table grape berries. On each of the five samples, frozen berries were dissected and RNA from flesh and skin was obtained and processed for Grapegen Genechip microarray hybridizations. ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.

At this stage berries were sampled with densities between 110-130 g NaCl/L for R1 and between 130-150 g NaCl/L for R2, which corresponded to commercially ripen table grape berries. On each of the five samples, frozen berries were dissected and RNA from flesh and skin was obtained and processed for Grapegen Genechip microarray hybridizations. ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.

At this stage berries were sampled with densities between 110-130 g NaCl/L for R1 and between 130-150 g NaCl/L for R2, which corresponded to commercially ripen table grape berries. On each of the five samples, frozen berries were dissected and RNA from flesh and skin was obtained and processed for Grapegen Genechip microarray hybridizations. ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.

At this stage berries were sampled with densities between 110-130 g NaCl/L for R1 and between 130-150 g NaCl/L for R2, which corresponded to commercially ripen table grape berries. On each of the five samples, frozen berries were dissected and RNA from flesh and skin was obtained and processed for Grapegen Genechip microarray hybridizations. ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.

Transcriptional profiles throughout flesh and skin ripening were followed in three biological replicas during two consecutive growing seasons in a table grape cultivar \xe2\xac\xdcMuscat Hamburg\xe2\xac". Berries were weekly picked off bunches (one bunch per vine from each selected vine) from june to august. For each sampling, berries were classified in five ripening stages based on monitoring developmental stages instead of a simple chronological sampling. They corresponded to pre-véraison (P), 50% véraison (V1), 100% véraison (V2), ripe 1 (R1), and ripe 2 R2). P samples were harvested as green, hard berries of at least 15 mm in size, according to touch-assessed hardiness. Véraison berries with half or full coloured skin surface corresponded to V1 and V2 samples. After véraison, ripening berries were classified according to their floatability in solutions with different NaCl densities, as an indication of the internal sugar concentration.

Fruiting cuttings were selected to have similar grape bunch size avoiding changes in berry quality. At least 9 plants were transferred to each treatment. Global pericarp gene expression was compared among the four growth conditions using the GrapeGen GeneChip®. The transcriptomic analysis was carried out in 14 DAT berries in order to identify stable responses to differential temperature and PPFD conditions not masked by quick transient responses to the environmental change. Moreover, grapes of the same density range (100-110 g NaCl·L-1)) from all four treatments were compared to ensure that treatment effects other than ripening rate shifts originated by the treatments, at least in terms of saccharimetric ripening, were being studied. ****[PLEXdb(http://www.plexdb.org) has submitted this series at GEO on behalf of the original contributor, Pablo Carbonell-Bejerano.

However, the complexity of molecular and biochemical events that lead to ripening of nonclimacteric fruits is not fully understood. In particular the role of polyamines´ catabolism has been little explored. Ripening of Trincadeira grapes submitted to mock and guazatine treatments, a potent inhibitor of polyamine oxidase activity, was studied taking into account the transcriptional and metabolic profilings complemented with biochemical data. The mRNA expression profiles of one time point (EL 38) corresponding to harvest stage was compared between mock and guazatine treatments using the Affymetrix GrapeGen® genome array containing 23096 probesets corresponding to 18711 unique sequences. A total of 2113 probesets (1877 unigenes) were significantly differentially expressed (1.5 fold) between these samples. These unigenes were assigned to the functional categories of \xe2\xacSmetabolism⬝, \xe2\xacSregulation overview⬝, \xe2\xacSsignaling⬝, \xe2\xacScellular process⬝, \xe2\xacStransport overview⬝, \xe2\xacSresponse to stimulus, stress⬝, \xe2\xacSdiverse/miscellaneous functions⬝, \xe2\xacSxenoprotein, transposable element⬝, \xe2\xacSdevelopment⬝ and \xe2\xacSunknown⬝. Quantitative RT-PCR validated microarrays results being carried out for seven selected genes and three developmental stages (EL 35, EL 36 and EL 38). Functional enrichment analysis revealed that genes involved in amino acid, carbohydrate and water transport were more up-regulated in mock treated samples which may suggest that the strong dehydrated phenotype obtained in guazatine treated samples may be due to impaired transport mechanisms. In addition, genes involved in terpenes´ metabolism were differentially expressed between guazatine and mock treated samples. Altogether, the results support an important role of polyamine catabolism in normal grape ripening namely in aroma development and cell expansion.

However, the complexity of molecular and biochemical events that lead to ripening of nonclimacteric fruits is not fully understood. In particular the role of polyamines´ catabolism has been little explored. Ripening of Trincadeira grapes submitted to mock and guazatine treatments, a potent inhibitor of polyamine oxidase activity, was studied taking into account the transcriptional and metabolic profilings complemented with biochemical data. The mRNA expression profiles of one time point (EL 38) corresponding to harvest stage was compared between mock and guazatine treatments using the Affymetrix GrapeGen® genome array containing 23096 probesets corresponding to 18711 unique sequences. A total of 2113 probesets (1877 unigenes) were significantly differentially expressed (1.5 fold) between these samples. These unigenes were assigned to the functional categories of \xe2\xacSmetabolism⬝, \xe2\xacSregulation overview⬝, \xe2\xacSsignaling⬝, \xe2\xacScellular process⬝, \xe2\xacStransport overview⬝, \xe2\xacSresponse to stimulus, stress⬝, \xe2\xacSdiverse/miscellaneous functions⬝, \xe2\xacSxenoprotein, transposable element⬝, \xe2\xacSdevelopment⬝ and \xe2\xacSunknown⬝. Quantitative RT-PCR validated microarrays results being carried out for seven selected genes and three developmental stages (EL 35, EL 36 and EL 38). Functional enrichment analysis revealed that genes involved in amino acid, carbohydrate and water transport were more up-regulated in mock treated samples which may suggest that the strong dehydrated phenotype obtained in guazatine treated samples may be due to impaired transport mechanisms. In addition, genes involved in terpenes´ metabolism were differentially expressed between guazatine and mock treated samples. Altogether, the results support an important role of polyamine catabolism in normal grape ripening namely in aroma development and cell expansion.

However, the complexity of molecular and biochemical events that lead to the onset of ripening of nonclimacteric fruits is not fully understood which is further complicated in grapes due to seasonal and cultivar specific variantion. The Portuguese wine variety Trincadeira gives rise to high quality wines but presents extremely irregular berry ripening among seasons probably due to high susceptibility to abiotic and biotic stresses. Results Ripening of Trincadeira grapes was studied taking into account the transcriptional and metabolic profilings complemented with biochemical data. The mRNA expression profiles of four time points spanning developmental stages from pea size green berries, through veraison and mature berries (EL 32, EL 34, EL 35 and EL 36) and in two seasons (2007 and 2008) were compared using the Affymetrix GrapeGen® genome array containing 23096 probesets corresponding to 18726 unique sequences. Over 50% of these probesets were significantly differentially expressed (1.5 fold) between at least two developmental stages. A common set of modulated transcripts corresponding to 5862 unigenes indicates the activation of common pathways in between years despite the irregular development of Trincadeira grapes. These unigenes were assigned in the functional categories of \xe2\xacSmetabolism, development⬝, \xe2\xacScellular process⬝, \xe2\xacSdiverse functions⬝, \xe2\xacSregulation overview⬝, \xe2\xacSresponse to stimulus, stress⬝, \xe2\xacSsignaling⬝, \xe2\xacStransport overview⬝, \xe2\xacSxenoprotein, transposable element⬝ and \xe2\xacSunknown⬝. Metabolic profiling using 1H NMR spectroscopy associated to two-dimensional techniques showed the importance of metabolites related to oxidative stress response, amino acid and sugar metabolism as well as secondary metabolism in grape ripening.

However, the complexity of molecular and biochemical events that lead to the onset of ripening of nonclimacteric fruits is not fully understood which is further complicated in grapes due to seasonal and cultivar specific variantion. The Portuguese wine variety Trincadeira gives rise to high quality wines but presents extremely irregular berry ripening among seasons probably due to high susceptibility to abiotic and biotic stresses. Results Ripening of Trincadeira grapes was studied taking into account the transcriptional and metabolic profilings complemented with biochemical data. The mRNA expression profiles of four time points spanning developmental stages from pea size green berries, through veraison and mature berries (EL 32, EL 34, EL 35 and EL 36) and in two seasons (2007 and 2008) were compared using the Affymetrix GrapeGen® genome array containing 23096 probesets corresponding to 18726 unique sequences. Over 50% of these probesets were significantly differentially expressed (1.5 fold) between at least two developmental stages. A common set of modulated transcripts corresponding to 5862 unigenes indicates the activation of common pathways in between years despite the irregular development of Trincadeira grapes. These unigenes were assigned in the functional categories of \xe2\xacSmetabolism, development⬝, \xe2\xacScellular process⬝, \xe2\xacSdiverse functions⬝, \xe2\xacSregulation overview⬝, \xe2\xacSresponse to stimulus, stress⬝, \xe2\xacSsignaling⬝, \xe2\xacStransport overview⬝, \xe2\xacSxenoprotein, transposable element⬝ and \xe2\xacSunknown⬝. Metabolic profiling using 1H NMR spectroscopy associated to two-dimensional techniques showed the importance of metabolites related to oxidative stress response, amino acid and sugar metabolism as well as secondary metabolism in grape ripening.

The mRNA expression profiles of four time points spanning developmental stages from pea size green berries, through veraison and mature berries (EL 32, EL 34, EL 35 and EL 36) and in two seasons (2007 and 2008) were compared using the Affymetrix GrapeGen® genome array containing 23096 probesets corresponding to 18726 unique sequences. Over 50% of these probesets were significantly differentially expressed (1.5 fold) between at least two developmental stages. A common set of modulated transcripts corresponding to 5862 unigenes indicates the activation of common pathways in between years despite the irregular development of Trincadeira grapes. These unigenes were assigned in the functional categories of \xe2\xacSmetabolism, development⬝, \xe2\xacScellular process⬝, \xe2\xacSdiverse functions⬝, \xe2\xacSregulation overview⬝, \xe2\xacSresponse to stimulus, stress⬝, \xe2\xacSsignaling⬝, \xe2\xacStransport overview⬝, \xe2\xacSxenoprotein, transposable element⬝ and \xe2\xacSunknown⬝. Metabolic profiling using 1H NMR spectroscopy associated to two-dimensional techniques showed the importance of metabolites related to oxidative stress response, amino acid and sugar metabolism as well as secondary metabolism in grape ripening. This information was integrated with transcriptional profiling obtained using genome array and qRT-PCR for five developmental stages (EL 32, EL 34, EL 35, EL 36 and EL 38). Conclusions Altogether the results provide new information regarding the network of events leading to grape ripening as well as highlight features that may be cultivar specific namely in what concerns the role of carbohydrates and growth regulators´ metabolism as well as epigenetic factors and signaling pathways.

However, the complexity of molecular and biochemical events that lead to the onset of ripening of nonclimacteric fruits is not fully understood which is further complicated in grapes due to seasonal and cultivar specific variantion. The Portuguese wine variety Trincadeira gives rise to high quality wines but presents extremely irregular berry ripening among seasons probably due to high susceptibility to abiotic and biotic stresses. Results Ripening of Trincadeira grapes was studied taking into account the transcriptional and metabolic profilings complemented with biochemical data. The mRNA expression profiles of four time points spanning developmental stages from pea size green berries, through veraison and mature berries (EL 32, EL 34, EL 35 and EL 36) and in two seasons (2007 and 2008) were compared using the Affymetrix GrapeGen® genome array containing 23096 probesets corresponding to 18726 unique sequences. Over 50% of these probesets were significantly differentially expressed (1.5 fold) between at least two developmental stages. A common set of modulated transcripts corresponding to 5862 unigenes indicates the activation of common pathways in between years despite the irregular development of Trincadeira grapes. These unigenes were assigned in the functional categories of \xe2\xacSmetabolism, development⬝, \xe2\xacScellular process⬝, \xe2\xacSdiverse functions⬝, \xe2\xacSregulation overview⬝, \xe2\xacSresponse to stimulus, stress⬝, \xe2\xacSsignaling⬝, \xe2\xacStransport overview⬝, \xe2\xacSxenoprotein, transposable element⬝ and \xe2\xacSunknown⬝. Metabolic profiling using 1H NMR spectroscopy associated to two-dimensional techniques showed the importance of metabolites related to oxidative stress response, amino acid and sugar metabolism as well as secondary metabolism in grape ripening.

The mRNA expression profiles of four time points spanning developmental stages from pea size green berries, through veraison and mature berries (EL 32, EL 34, EL 35 and EL 36) and in two seasons (2007 and 2008) were compared using the Affymetrix GrapeGen® genome array containing 23096 probesets corresponding to 18726 unique sequences. Over 50% of these probesets were significantly differentially expressed (1.5 fold) between at least two developmental stages. A common set of modulated transcripts corresponding to 5862 unigenes indicates the activation of common pathways in between years despite the irregular development of Trincadeira grapes. These unigenes were assigned in the functional categories of \xe2\xacSmetabolism, development⬝, \xe2\xacScellular process⬝, \xe2\xacSdiverse functions⬝, \xe2\xacSregulation overview⬝, \xe2\xacSresponse to stimulus, stress⬝, \xe2\xacSsignaling⬝, \xe2\xacStransport overview⬝, \xe2\xacSxenoprotein, transposable element⬝ and \xe2\xacSunknown⬝. Metabolic profiling using 1H NMR spectroscopy associated to two-dimensional techniques showed the importance of metabolites related to oxidative stress response, amino acid and sugar metabolism as well as secondary metabolism in grape ripening. This information was integrated with transcriptional profiling obtained using genome array and qRT-PCR for five developmental stages (EL 32, EL 34, EL 35, EL 36 and EL 38). Conclusions Altogether the results provide new information regarding the network of events leading to grape ripening as well as highlight features that may be cultivar specific namely in what concerns the role of carbohydrates and growth regulators´ metabolism as well as epigenetic factors and signaling pathways.

For each sample, tissues were collected in the selected developmental stage randomly from 20 of the 240 plants of each block. In this way, each replicate of the same sample came from a different block. Inflorescence developmental stages were classified following the developmental series of Baggiolini [Baggiolini M (1952). Rev Romande Agric Vitic Arboric 8: 46] and the modified E-L system .[Coombe BG (1995). Aust J Grape Wine Res 1: 104110] Inflorescence primordia from stage B were collected after hand dissection of early stage B buds from which inflorescences bearing only inflorescence branch meristems but not flower meristems. Inflorescences D and G correspond to the first inflorescence of the shoot in phenological stages D and G respectively. Inflorescences I correspond to flowers of the middle part of inflorescences at stage I.  Tendril samples were collected from the first, third and fifth tendrils of stage I shoots. Tendril number 1 corresponds to the latest developed by the shoot apex and was processed as a whole. Samples of tendrils in third and fifth positions were taken from part of their three main regions: the inner and outer arms, the branching zone and the hypoclade zone. Each independent pool was independently frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from frozen samples according to Reid et al., 2006 [Reid KE, Olsson N, Schlosser J, Peng F, Lund ST (2006). BMC Plant Biol 6: 27]. RNA purification was performed using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer's protocols. To remove DNA traces in RNA samples, DNase I digestion was carried out with the RNase-Free DNase Set (QIAGEN). RNA integrity and quantity were assessed by Agilents Bioanalyzer 2100. biotin

For each sample, tissues were collected in the selected developmental stage randomly from 20 of the 240 plants of each block. In this way, each replicate of the same sample came from a different block. Inflorescence developmental stages were classified following the developmental series of Baggiolini [Baggiolini M (1952). Rev Romande Agric Vitic Arboric 8: 46] and the modified E-L system .[Coombe BG (1995). Aust J Grape Wine Res 1: 104110] Inflorescence primordia from stage B were collected after hand dissection of early stage B buds from which inflorescences bearing only inflorescence branch meristems but not flower meristems. Inflorescences D and G correspond to the first inflorescence of the shoot in phenological stages D and G respectively. Inflorescences I correspond to flowers of the middle part of inflorescences at stage I.  Tendril samples were collected from the first, third and fifth tendrils of stage I shoots. Tendril number 1 corresponds to the latest developed by the shoot apex and was processed as a whole. Samples of tendrils in third and fifth positions were taken from part of their three main regions: the inner and outer arms, the branching zone and the hypoclade zone. Each independent pool was independently frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from frozen samples according to Reid et al., 2006 [Reid KE, Olsson N, Schlosser J, Peng F, Lund ST (2006).

For each sample, tissues were collected in the selected developmental stage randomly from 20 of the 240 plants of each block. In this way, each replicate of the same sample came from a different block. Inflorescence developmental stages were classified following the developmental series of Baggiolini [Baggiolini M (1952). Rev Romande Agric Vitic Arboric 8: 46] and the modified E-L system .[Coombe BG (1995). Aust J Grape Wine Res 1: 104110] Inflorescence primordia from stage B were collected after hand dissection of early stage B buds from which inflorescences bearing only inflorescence branch meristems but not flower meristems. Inflorescences D and G correspond to the first inflorescence of the shoot in phenological stages D and G respectively. Inflorescences I correspond to flowers of the middle part of inflorescences at stage I.  Tendril samples were collected from the first, third and fifth tendrils of stage I shoots. Tendril number 1 corresponds to the latest developed by the shoot apex and was processed as a whole. Samples of tendrils in third and fifth positions were taken from part of their three main regions: the inner and outer arms, the branching zone and the hypoclade zone. Each independent pool was independently frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from frozen samples according to Reid et al., 2006 [Reid KE, Olsson N, Schlosser J, Peng F, Lund ST (2006).

For each sample, tissues were collected in the selected developmental stage randomly from 20 of the 240 plants of each block. In this way, each replicate of the same sample came from a different block. Inflorescence developmental stages were classified following the developmental series of Baggiolini [Baggiolini M (1952). Rev Romande Agric Vitic Arboric 8: 46] and the modified E-L system .[Coombe BG (1995). Aust J Grape Wine Res 1: 104110] Inflorescence primordia from stage B were collected after hand dissection of early stage B buds from which inflorescences bearing only inflorescence branch meristems but not flower meristems. Inflorescences D and G correspond to the first inflorescence of the shoot in phenological stages D and G respectively. Inflorescences I correspond to flowers of the middle part of inflorescences at stage I.  Tendril samples were collected from the first, third and fifth tendrils of stage I shoots. Tendril number 1 corresponds to the latest developed by the shoot apex and was processed as a whole. Samples of tendrils in third and fifth positions were taken from part of their three main regions: the inner and outer arms, the branching zone and the hypoclade zone. Each independent pool was independently frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from frozen samples according to Reid et al., 2006 [Reid KE, Olsson N, Schlosser J, Peng F, Lund ST (2006).

For each sample, tissues were collected in the selected developmental stage randomly from 20 of the 240 plants of each block. In this way, each replicate of the same sample came from a different block. Inflorescence developmental stages were classified following the developmental series of Baggiolini [Baggiolini M (1952). Rev Romande Agric Vitic Arboric 8: 46] and the modified E-L system .[Coombe BG (1995). Aust J Grape Wine Res 1: 104110] Inflorescence primordia from stage B were collected after hand dissection of early stage B buds from which inflorescences bearing only inflorescence branch meristems but not flower meristems. Inflorescences D and G correspond to the first inflorescence of the shoot in phenological stages D and G respectively. Inflorescences I correspond to flowers of the middle part of inflorescences at stage I.  Tendril samples were collected from the first, third and fifth tendrils of stage I shoots. Tendril number 1 corresponds to the latest developed by the shoot apex and was processed as a whole. Samples of tendrils in third and fifth positions were taken from part of their three main regions: the inner and outer arms, the branching zone and the hypoclade zone. Each independent pool was independently frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from frozen samples according to Reid et al., 2006 [Reid KE, Olsson N, Schlosser J, Peng F, Lund ST (2006).

For each sample, tissues were collected in the selected developmental stage randomly from 20 of the 240 plants of each block. In this way, each replicate of the same sample came from a different block. Inflorescence developmental stages were classified following the developmental series of Baggiolini [Baggiolini M (1952). Rev Romande Agric Vitic Arboric 8: 46] and the modified E-L system .[Coombe BG (1995). Aust J Grape Wine Res 1: 104110] Inflorescence primordia from stage B were collected after hand dissection of early stage B buds from which inflorescences bearing only inflorescence branch meristems but not flower meristems. Inflorescences D and G correspond to the first inflorescence of the shoot in phenological stages D and G respectively. Inflorescences I correspond to flowers of the middle part of inflorescences at stage I.  Tendril samples were collected from the first, third and fifth tendrils of stage I shoots. Tendril number 1 corresponds to the latest developed by the shoot apex and was processed as a whole. Samples of tendrils in third and fifth positions were taken from part of their three main regions: the inner and outer arms, the branching zone and the hypoclade zone. Each independent pool was independently frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from frozen samples according to Reid et al., 2006 [Reid KE, Olsson N, Schlosser J, Peng F, Lund ST (2006).

For each sample, tissues were collected in the selected developmental stage randomly from 20 of the 240 plants of each block. In this way, each replicate of the same sample came from a different block. Inflorescence developmental stages were classified following the developmental series of Baggiolini [Baggiolini M (1952). Rev Romande Agric Vitic Arboric 8: 46] and the modified E-L system .[Coombe BG (1995). Aust J Grape Wine Res 1: 104110] Inflorescence primordia from stage B were collected after hand dissection of early stage B buds from which inflorescences bearing only inflorescence branch meristems but not flower meristems. Inflorescences D and G correspond to the first inflorescence of the shoot in phenological stages D and G respectively. Inflorescences I correspond to flowers of the middle part of inflorescences at stage I.  Tendril samples were collected from the first, third and fifth tendrils of stage I shoots. Tendril number 1 corresponds to the latest developed by the shoot apex and was processed as a whole. Samples of tendrils in third and fifth positions were taken from part of their three main regions: the inner and outer arms, the branching zone and the hypoclade zone. Each independent pool was independently frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from frozen samples according to Reid et al., 2006 [Reid KE, Olsson N, Schlosser J, Peng F, Lund ST (2006).

For each sample, tissues were collected in the selected developmental stage randomly from 20 of the 240 plants of each block. In this way, each replicate of the same sample came from a different block. Inflorescence developmental stages were classified following the developmental series of Baggiolini [Baggiolini M (1952). Rev Romande Agric Vitic Arboric 8: 46] and the modified E-L system .[Coombe BG (1995). Aust J Grape Wine Res 1: 104110] Inflorescence primordia from stage B were collected after hand dissection of early stage B buds from which inflorescences bearing only inflorescence branch meristems but not flower meristems. Inflorescences D and G correspond to the first inflorescence of the shoot in phenological stages D and G respectively. Inflorescences I correspond to flowers of the middle part of inflorescences at stage I.  Tendril samples were collected from the first, third and fifth tendrils of stage I shoots. Tendril number 1 corresponds to the latest developed by the shoot apex and was processed as a whole. Samples of tendrils in third and fifth positions were taken from part of their three main regions: the inner and outer arms, the branching zone and the hypoclade zone. Each independent pool was independently frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from frozen samples according to Reid et al., 2006 [Reid KE, Olsson N, Schlosser J, Peng F, Lund ST (2006).

Irrigation water was applied with drip emitters (4.0 L h-1 for FI) two per vine, positioned 30 cm from the vine trunk. The water was supplied according to the crop\xe2\xac"s evapotranspiration (ETc). Samples were taken when the pre dawn leaf water potential was circa -0.7MPa in the NI plants and higher than -0.2MPa in the FI plants. To assess physiological effects of stress treatments: Individual stresses were applied when shoots were 50 to 60 cm high (after circa four months growth). The stresses applied were: W (Water)\xe2\xac\034 stop irrigation until the pre-dawn leaf water potential (Ψw) was -0.9 MPa; L (Light) \xe2\xac\034 1 hour at 2000µmolm2s-1; H (Heat) \xe2\xac\034 1 hour at 42ºC

Irrigation water was applied with drip emitters (4.0 L h-1 for FI) two per vine, positioned 30 cm from the vine trunk. The water was supplied according to the crop\xe2\xac"s evapotranspiration (ETc). Samples were taken when the pre dawn leaf water potential was circa -0.7MPa in the NI plants and higher than -0.2MPa in the FI plants. To assess physiological effects of stress treatments: Individual stresses were applied when shoots were 50 to 60 cm high (after circa four months growth).
